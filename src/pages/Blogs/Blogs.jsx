          refer to components that are directly controlled by the application,
          meaning the application manages the state and behavior of the
          component. These components are typically custom-built for the
          specific application and have a clear interface with the application.
          Examples of controlled components include buttons, text inputs, and
          custom UI elements.

          <span className="font-semibold underline">
            Uncontrolled components
          </span>
          , on the other hand, are components that manage their own state
          internally and do not have a clear interface with the application.
          These components are often pre-built and provided by third-party
          libraries or frameworks. Examples of uncontrolled components include
          HTML form elements such as checkboxes and radio buttons.

          2. How to validate React props using PropTypes?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-500 mx-5">
          React, PropTypes is a library that is used to validate the props of a
          component. PropTypes is a built-in feature of React, which provides a
          way to specify the type and structure of props that a component
          expects to receive. By using PropTypes, developers can ensure that the
          components are being used correctly and avoid bugs caused by incorrect
          usage of props.
          <br />
          Here are some common PropTypes validation: 
          <ul>
            <li>PropTypes.string</li>
            <li>PropTypes.number</li>
            <li>PropTypes.bool</li>
            <li>PropTypes.func</li>
            <li>PropTypes.array</li>
            <li>PropTypes.object</li>
          </ul>

          3.Tell us the difference between nodejs and express js.
        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-500 mx-5">
          Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript
          engine. It allows developers to write server-side JavaScript code that
          can be executed on the server. Node.js provides a non-blocking I/O
          model that allows for fast and scalable server-side applications. With
          Node.js, developers can build back-end services, APIs, and other
          server-side applications.
          <br />
          Express.js, on the other hand, is a web framework built on top of
          Node.js. It provides a simple and flexible API for building web
          applications and APIs. Express.js provides features like routing,
          middleware, and templating that make it easier to build web
          applications. With Express.js, developers can build web applications
          and APIs quickly and easily.

          4. What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-500 mx-5 pb-16">
          In React, a custom hook is a JavaScript function that uses one or more
          built-in React hooks to encapsulate a certain piece of logic and make
          it reusable across different components. Custom hooks allow developers
          to extract and reuse stateful logic from components, making the code
          more organized, readable, and maintainable. Custom hooks allow
          developers to abstract away complex logic and functionality from
          components, reducing the amount of code duplication and making it
          easier to maintain the codebase. By encapsulating common logic in a
          custom hook, developers can avoid code duplication and improve the
          overall code quality. Custom hooks are prefixed with the word "use" to
          indicate that they are built on top of the built-in React hooks. A
          custom hook can use any of the built-in React hooks, including
          useState, useEffect, useContext, and useRef.
